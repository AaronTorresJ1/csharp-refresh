C# Refresh Course. 


After graduating the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy, I started my career in tech as a Support Engineer for nCino. My work primarily focuses on the Salesforce Platform where nCino is built. 

I decided to refresh my programming skills in C# and git for the 100 days of code challenge. 

I recently discovered my fascination of git so I will be pushing all my changes to this repository using the git bash terminal!
