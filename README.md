C# Refresh Course. 
After graduating the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy, I started my career in tech as a Support Engineer for nCino. My work primarily focuses
on the Salesforce Platform where nCino is built. 

I decided to refresh my programming skills in C# and git for the 100 days of code challenge.
